# Ask the user for the following:
# 1. Ask the user for the price of a child and an adult meal and store these values properly into variables as floating point numbers.
# 2. Ask the user for the number of adults and children and store these values properly into variables as integers.
# 3. Compute and display the subtotal (you do not need to worry about the sales tax or rounding to two decimals at this point).

# Final requirements / Submission
# 1. Ask the user for the sales tax rate and store the value properly as a floating point number.
# 2. Compute and display the sales tax.
# 3. Compute and display the total.
# 4. Ask the user for the payment amount and store the value properly as a floating point number.
# 5. Compute and display the change.
# 6. Include the appropriate currency symbol (for example $, â‚¬, etc.) before each displayed value.
# 7. Display each value to two decimals.
# 8. Double check that the calculations are correct.
# 9. Show creativity and exceed the core requirements by adding additional features.
# 10. Use good style in your program, including variable names and whitespace.

# Qstn : how to run the code without having to run the whole program?
